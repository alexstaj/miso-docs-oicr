Presentation stuff

* give everyone one two stickies/flags: one to indicate done, the other for distress
* 15 min lecture + 15 min doing things
* no more than 2h blocks
* save presentation using Camtasia (save whole thing, then edit out working sessions)
* check with communications re video upload, CBW does its own thing
* don't demo (let them work through the instructions)
* put diagram of workflow in presentation with highlighted section (like we had on the wiki)
