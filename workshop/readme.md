1. Creating projects
  1. organisational details of projects?
      1. projects vs subprojects
      1. access control associated with projects
      1. studies (what they are for)
  1. shortnames vs names → pinery implications
      1. MT: Lab doesn't use pinery
1. Incoming samples
  1. identity & data model stuff
      1. permission inheritance
      1. institutes and labs
  1. Bulk sample entry (HoT)
      1. demo copy-paste
      1. demo fill down
  1. single interface
      1. MT: ??
  1. synthetic/ghost entities
1. Samples
  1. searching!
  1. individual edit sample
  1. Bulk edit samples (HoT)
  1. propagating and data model (especially tissue processing data model)
      1. kits?
      1. group IDs
      1. QC information
  1. bulk HoT interface
      1. MT: same as c?
1. boxes: store samples and libraries, NOT reagents, inventory, primers, etc.
  1. data model
  1. collect created samples into a box
1. libraries
  1. library/dilution/pool data model
  1. QC information
  1. should emPCRs be mentioned?
  1. library design
  1. note that second barcode is optional in dual-index barcodes
  1. searching
  1. bulk HoT propagate
  1. add libraries to a box
      1. can we get a handscanner for demo? Is that worth it?
1. pools & dilutions
  1. ghostiness of dilutions
  1. pools as sequencable entities
  1. ready to run
      1. low quality libraries
  1. create a pool
1. runs and orders
  1. goals of the data model
  1. create order on a pool
  1. talk about notification server
  1. create PC, populate it, attach it to a run
      1. HA: we should talk to sequencing team and figure out how they want the protocol to run – do you create a PC, populate it, and attach it to a run, or do you wait for the run and PC to be auto-created and then populate it?
  1. unfulfilled orders page
1. my account/admin stuff
  1. I'm not sure if we should bother
  1. institutes and labs
  1. tissue origin/material/types
  1. sample purposes
1. Things that need to go somewhere:
  1. experiments!
  1. consumables
  1. alerts? Does anyone care?
  1. PacBio?
